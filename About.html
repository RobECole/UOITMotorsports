          <p>In response to the formula challenge posted by the Society of Automotive Engineers, a
       group of dedicated students from the University of Ontario Institute of Technology have 
       formed UOIT Motorsports. The team’s purpose is to design, budget and build their formula-
       style race car to compete at various international FSAE challenges. </p>

          <p>Our team's goal is to design, fabricate and race a competitive FSAE vehicle in a multitude of Formula SAE events. The team operates on the premise that we have been contracted to produce a prototype car for evaluation and for possible production. Founded in (year), UOIT Motorsports has built (n) generations of cars and is currently working on (n+1). The video below is a look at our first car from (2007?)</p>

      <h4>What is FSAE?</h4>

      <p> 
      In 1979, the Society of Automotive Engineers created the “Mini-Indy”. The event was designed 
      to give aspiring engineers a project that would involve the design of a race car, the 
      construction process and the project management responsibilities associated with it. By 
      1997, this event was renamed to “formula SAE”, and had grown to an international level. FSAE 
      has afforded passionate engineering students an amazing opportunity in designing, 
      constructing and managing the production of a high speed race car. These prototypes are 
      judged based on cost, effective use of materials, and overall design concepts.
