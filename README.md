# UOITMotorsports
Website for UOIT Motorsports

The idea is to keep it simple for now, just so there is something better than the current place holder. Later I want to re-assess the project and additional features (such as actually using a back end of some sort). In terms of maintaining the web site, I'll upload the repository to the FTP server after it gets approved.

Things that need done:

- there needs to be a facebook link to the community page
- proper links to the youtube UOITMotorsports youtube video
- Text content needs to be created and added
- Photos need to replace the place holders
- Gallery page: just a page displaying all the pictures in one place
- Sponsors page: needs to reflect the current state of sponsors (will upload a text file soon) and need to collect logos for sponsors
- Photoshoping images: the baner images would look nicer if there was some text shopped on top, to make it look less flat and kind of out of place
